- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
- - The day to day work will be very variable because of the limited time for the project as well as the unknown hurdles we will need to face. That said, the plan is to have tasks for each individual assigned in the morning, and then a check in later in the day to see how everyone progressed during the first half of the day. This will be the time when everyone can review the progress of the others and gain insight into all aspects of the project.

## Conflict Plan ##
- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- - The first step will be a discussion between the involved team members to try and align the vision on what is causing the conflict. If this does not solve the issue then the third team member will come in as an arbitrator and add their vote to one side’s argument or the other. 
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- - The other two team members should come to that person and let them know that they are displeased with the workload. This should cause the team to go through the efforts of dividing up the responsibilities again to ensure that all members have the greatest opportunity to learn.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- - By dividing up the responsibilities and checking in with the other team members during the course of this project we will make sure that if any team member is struggling that the others will then either allocate time to help them, or take some of the load from their shoulders. The internal communications between team members are important.
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- - In the team meetings we will address concerns over workloads. As well as the previously discussed reasons for this meeting it will also be a chance for the team members to ask others to pick up some of the slack if they are feeling overwhelmed.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- - First the resolution between the two involved team members will be attempted. Next the team escalates to bringing in the third to mediate, and if the issue still remains unresolved a TA or instructor will be brought in for final arbitration.

## Communication Plan ##
- What hours will you be available to communicate?
- - All team members will be available from 9-6, with an hour for a lunch break in the middle.
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- - The team will use discord for communication, and Github for team management software.
- How often will you take breaks?
- - A ten minute break will be possible for every hour of work, and an hour lunch break will be somewhere in the middle of the day.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- - If we start to fall behind a change to the scope of the project by pruning off extra features will be discussed by the team. 
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- - Discord and slack will be used to communicate between the team after hours.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- - The way to ensure everyone’s voice is heard is the meeting for the team to catch up and talk about their days. Also the fact that there are only 3 people in the group help to give everyone’s voice an easier path to being heard.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- - By checking up with all team members consistently we will ensure that 

## Work Plan ##
- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- - Tasks will be assigned on Github projects, this will be used to track tasks from first assigning to completion.
- What project management tool will be used?
- - The management tool that will be used is the Github Projects tool.
- Git Process
- - What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- - - All code elements of the project will be stored on Github
- - How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- - - All team members will have access to the github repository and can clone i down at their leisure
- - What is your Git flow?
- - - Each developer should push to the development branch, and have a review from the other team members to do this.
- - Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
- - - No because that is now a paid feature in github.
